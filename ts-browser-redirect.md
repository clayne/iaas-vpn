# Why do I get redirected by the browser to install MotionPro client when it's already installed on my Mac?
{: #troubleshoot-browser-redirect}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

This is a known issue with the combination of the OSX Operating System (macOS BigSur 11.4) and the Firefox browser (89.0.2 64-bits).
{: shortdesc}

This might occur when you visit the URL site for the VPN directly and log in. 
{: tsSymptoms}

To avoid this issue, launch the MotionPro client from your local system rather than accessing one of the VPN endpoints from a browser.
